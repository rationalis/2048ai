# 2048ai

This is a Java implementation of a game playing AI for [2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_\(video_game\)),
based primarily on nneonneo's [C++ implementation](https://github.com/nneonneo/2048-ai). It includes a basic GUI
for playing the game (which `Game.main()` will start). The number keys 1, 2, 3, and 4 will start the
corresponding AIs: random, naive, expectimax, and "improved" expectimax.
